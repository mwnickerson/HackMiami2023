# Slide 2: Goals for the presentation 
- Explain my story of getting into cyber security from a non-technical career and the lessons I learned
- Share the resources that helped build my skills and knowledge
- Help leverage your strengths and bukd on your weaknesses to stand out and succeed
- Explain the mindset that helped me develop a strategy 

# slide 3: What this presentation is not
The goal of this presentation is not to give you a clear roadmap to get into cybersecurity in X amount of time but instead help you understand my process and help you identify the best practices that led me to succeas

It's also not going to be a 30 minute autobiography of my life

Not a list of resources however I will include those in the github repo for this talk 


# slide 4: Matthew 0.1
Growing up my family had one computer that we would all share with dial up

I loved the computer for playing games and eventually started to use the internet more going to chat rooms or image boards

I came into the internet around the time anonymous and other hacktivist groups were gaining prominence and this lead me to develop a hobbyist interest in hacking and cybersecurity 

I was never someone who was hitting websites or getting into networks but I enjoyed reading about the various things people were doing and always wanted to learn. 

I think my first "hack" was when myfamily first got WiFi when I was in high school and my dad wouldn't give the password because it was for his work.  I figured out how to get into the router admin console with a default username and password and found the password for my iPod touch 
- it's funny bc In my current role there are always findings of admin consoles with default passwords

I made a couple of attempts to become "technical" and study computer programming but the classes I was in were mainly math

I eventually decided business was best for me and took the steps to start a career in business. 
Out of college I was hired as a customer success manager for a telecomm in south Florida. 

The job eventually evolved into a project manager role which I enjoyed, but when covid happened the role devolved into essentially a VIP customer service role and I started to lose satisfaction in my job

In 2021 my role was downsized, and I took the option for severance and I reached a crossroads of my career

# slide 5: crossroads Takeaways

I knew I wanted to move into tech and originally wanted to become a developer, however while researching I discovered that Cybersecurity was a massively growing field and something I already had a hobbyist interest in as well as some knowledge from talking with friends and reading online
 
After coming to terms with my career changing I began the process of evaluating my strengths, weaknesses, and satisfactions. 

I first identified my weaknesses and bad habits
- I was stubborn
- I had a hard time asking people for help 
- I was an undisplined studier while at university 
- I had a very limited technical background
- I would often waste time on YouTube, social media, and playing video games

I then looked at my strengths
- strong people skills due to years of customer service and sales
- I was very good with trouble shooting picked up through customer service and my hobby of using my 3d printer
- I had a knack for analytical thinking and planning due to working in project management
- Excelled in taking concepts and explaining them appropriately to the target due to the necessity in project management to bridge gaps between different departments

Finally I looked at my limitations
- I had an estimated financial burn rate of six months
- due to being unemployed I had unlimited time during that six month period 
- I also knew from being on the hiring side of things in previous roles that having a gap of more than a year would look bad as an applicant 

The information gained during this time would be used to set my course, dedicate my efforts, as well as make changes to my life

# slide 6: creating a roadmap
The first step to embarking on any journey is to create a roadmap of where you want to go and how you will reach that end point. 

Upon selecting my endpoint of a career in cyber security I began to research the best way to get there. My first research was just done through googling. I am across two potential paths:
- go back to school
- go to a cyber security bootcamp 

The issue with both of these is they were very cost prohibitive as well as antithetical to my negative of being a poor student and stubborness

I went through a lot of conversations with my parents and they attempted to convince me to ask for some advice from someone I didn't quite know that was heavily embedded in the cyber security industry. I was hesitant at first due to my reluctance to ask for help, but eventually decided to do it. This decision to go out of my comfort zone ended up paying off majorly and opened up a potential third Avenue:
- self study and certifications and real world experience through adjacent entry level fields

Through my conversation I also found where in cybersecurity I wanted to go, into Offensive Security.
For me the driving factor wasnt the "cool" factor on pentesting, however it was the drive to constantly face new challenges and find out of the box ways to tackle them, as well as the fact there is always new things to learn 
The other driving factor was that I felt as though my soft skills would help me stand out due to my experience in client facing positions as well as my strong writing and presentation skills 
I just needed to fill my gaps in technical know how

These gaps would be filled with "stops" along my journey 
- Security + to get a basic knowledge of security 
- CEH to get a basic knowledge of OffSec
- eJPT to get a hands on offsec cert 
- OSCP A cert i knew about prior to my journey and a major milestone along my journey

In order to get from stop to stop and eventually my end goal, I would need to utilize a lot of different resources or in my metaphor roads
- These roads can be paid or freely available
Although its possible to reach my destination without roads, it would require a lot more time and probably cause a lot of damage to myself (finanical and mental)

Finally to get the most out of these roads I would need to utilize existing habits, build new ones, and turn negative ones into positives

All of these things went onto my road map in an effort to keep me focused and on the right path towards my goal


# Slide 7: Turning bad habits positive 
I am willing to bet that everyone in this room is aware of at least one bad habit, and again i am willing to bet that we probably share at least one of these bad habits *cough cough social media doom scrolling*

I really used to enjoy a lot of video games and instead of getting the dopamine hit from checking boxs in video games, i would go through try hack me rooms or boxes on hack the box

I had a bad habit of just mindlessley scrolling on various social media. I took a good look at my accounts and started to curate the algorithm towards cybersecurity
- Removed content that wasnt relevant, liked and gave view content or copied link to save to read in my noted for later

Never really been a streaming services person, however i always enjoyed youtube content. I started to watch conference talks, ippsec and john hammond vides when i was unwinding from studying for the night

Overall something you should always be doing is going outside your comfort zone in order to develop and become better
- think about strength training.... you crate microtears in muscles to make them better
	- This wouldnt be possible if we didnt push our selves

During the process its going to be hard but you have to keep going I promise you that you will look back on the 10 hour work days into 8 hour study nights and see that it was all worth it



# Slide 8: Leveraging Your Strengths to Stand Out
Since we are coming from outside the industry a lot of us have a different viewpoint

People with a pure technical background lack some skills due to their nature of work 
- social skills
- patience with non-technical people
- ability to explain technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders

I am under the belief that in order for CyberSecurity to grow we need a cacophony of different viewpoints

Different careers and jobs build different strengths
- IE my client facing role in sales made me comfortable speaking and presenting to clients
- My skills built during project management related to explaining technical things in a broad scope to non technical people give me an advantage 

I swear one of the reasons why I was able to get my current position is that I love to write. I spent a lot of my time during my journey working on my blog. I would write about my process as well as  some writeups for boxes or things I was working on. During my interview I made sure to highlight my blog as well as my enjoyment of writing
- I knew beforehand that a lot of pentesters do not enjoy the reporting process, but I made sure to let the interviewers knew that I would be happy to help writing reports and really did enjoy writing

CyberSecurity is a huge field and I am positive that have you have skills built from your previous career and life experiences that will help grow the field. You just need to find what that skill is and highlight it within your 


# Slide 9: Detours, Flat Tires, And Car Troubles
Along our way to our journey we will encounter problems and as cheesy as it sounds its not the problems you encounter but how you tackle them

During the first part of my journey i thought i was going to be able to get a job right away after a couple of certs.... this wasnt necessarily true, but instead of complaining i pivoted

I knew that if i got a hands on chance doing IT work i would be able to stand out a little more from others who were just chasing certs
- this is where i started seeking a help desk job
	- One of the best decisions within my journey 

Always keep the end goal in mind and the troubles will be well worth it 

# Slide 10: Help Desk
I made a big sacrifice to my ego after getting three cyber security certs to do help desk

It ended up paying off big time and I recommend it to anyone trying to get in

The lessons learned were unlike anything I received during any certifications course
- user behavior and IT admin behavior 
- challenges of a network and network administration 

If you think about it Help Desk technicians are the people on the front lines of the war that is cybersecurity 

There are numerous small msps all over the country that hold together the small businesses that make our economy in the United States so great 
- Oftentimes these companies live on month to month profits in order to stay in business and a cyber incident can end their operations 
- Unfortantely these orgs cannot afford a top tier cyber security program or any at all
By taking our lessons learned during our journey we can implement these in our small business and overall grow the cybersecurity stance of not just the massive orgs but the mom and pop businesses that mean so much to our communities 

During my time in help desk, i implemented phishing training for orgs that in no way would have been able to afford something like knowb4 or similar
I implemented a vulnerability scanning program for some of our clients 
All using open-source projects that i learned about through my studies 

Use every opportunity that you can to grow as a cybersecurity professional
- one of my most memorable was trickbot being dropped via a phishing payload the night before thanksgiving


# Slide 11: Participate in the Community 
One of the reasons I decided I wanted to give this talk is due to the fact that the community helped me so greatly and was very important in aiding me along my journey

One of the first hacker meetups I went to was actually from HackMiami. Covid was still in play so I attended many of their virtual events and I learned a tremendous amount from the people within the group. 

There are a variety of places to find these groups, some places I personally would recommend would be the app MeetUp as well as the app eventbrite.
When I moved I found a lot of success looking for my local defconn groups and some of my coworkers recommended that I metnion looking for your local 2600 meetup. 

Another great place to find like minded people is the platform Discord. Over the course of my journey so far i Have joined a lot of discords both bigger and smaller. One that stands out to me is the Black Hills Information Security and their partner discord for the training courses from Anti-Syphon. There are always interesting discussions and there is also an opportunity to speak with other people who have the same goals. I have made many connections from these servers and will even recommend some of my connections for open positions within my own and other companies i have connections at now.

# Slide 12: Persistence Is Key 
One of the things I found during my journey is how important persistence is to being successful
Often time i would be stumped on boxes for hours, and I would keep reading and reading about what could help me figure them out, and along the way I would often pick up more information than i even needed to be successful 

The key to being persistent is to learn from your failures. Failure sucks but we often learn way more from failure than we do from success. My first attempt at OSCP i failed pretty miserably on the active directory portion. The reason for my failure wasnt lack of knowledge but instead a lack of documentation. My notes were scattered about and I could not find them when i needed it most. I went back after my failure and read books on hownto organize my thoughts and ended up creating a pretty useful "cheatsheet" that had collections of boxes and summaries along with thee technqiues used on them. My second attempt at OSCP i ended up breezing through the test in about 8 hours.

The same can be applied to actually applying for jobs. I applied to a lot of jobs, and received a lot of rejections. I did a good amount of interviews and got ghosted or rejected afterwards. I remember my first cyber security interview for a company as a SOC Analyst i was so excited for, and i ended up bombing the living hell out of the technical interview due to it being my first and not quite knowing what to expect. I was so upset afterwards, but i wrote down each of the questions and learned from my mistakes and used the lessons to actually get a job offer for another SOC analyst role that i ended up turnin down.

For my curent role, I had initially applied to be a Sr. Pentester because that what was listed on linkedin and other job sites. To be honest i dont think i even received a rejection letter, but I had read a lot about Layer 8 Security and I knew it was something i wanted to be a part of. I followed the company on LinkedIn and even looked at a lot of the employees, and when I saw that they were hiring I made sure to apply, but not only apply. I even reached out to my eventual manager and told them about the different things I admired about the company. I feel as though this helped me stand out from other candidates when I applied and part of why i eventually was hired


# Slide 13: Final Thoughts 
Take in a lot of advice from all over from a variety of sources. Use this advice to inform your journey but dont use it as a roadmap or take it as gospel. If its something you want and you believe you can do go for it
- when i looked at being in offensive security so much advice on various sources across the web said you ouldnt jump right to offensive security, if i had taken this advice i dont think i would have applied for my curent role and probably wouldnt have as much of a satisfaction for my job as i do now

Sacrifices are going to be crucial. 
This piece of advice may not be for everyone and may offend some, but i believe it is what helped me move towards my goal so quickly 
As much as the current culutral zeitgeist likes to harp on work life balance and living your life, I dont believe that I would have been as successful had i taken this attitude.
If you want success you have to work for it and sacrifice for it. 
People like Tiger Woods, or Michael Jordan didnt get where they were by putting in forty hour weeks of training.
I knew what I wanted to do and I really wanted it. I was willing to put in probably unhealthy long hours of studying. 
I by no means was wealthy, and I remember taking the money for an upcoming vacation and putting it towards paying for my OSCP course and having to tell friends I wouldnt be able to go.
For months i lived cybersecurity, going from studying to hack the boxes or try hack to Ippsec videos. 

Dont be intimidated!
If there is a job you want apply for it, and reach out to the hiring manager and tell them how excited you are to apply 
If there is a question you have reach out to someone. So many people in this industry love to help others and collaborate. And of course if you have any questions or need advice you can always reach out to me!

Finally! 
WHEN you get into the industry make sure to pay it forward
- look for opportunties to help others into the industry 
- talk or blog about your experiences
- Encourage leaders within your org to look outside of the tech community
